   - Compatible with modern documentation platforms and static site generators

2. **Empowering Writers**:
   - Reduced context switching with real-time preview
   - Built-in support for technical content like math equations and diagrams
   - Focus on content rather than formatting

3. **Supporting Learning**:
   - Integrated resources for learning Markdown
   - Immediate visual feedback helps reinforce Markdown syntax
   - Community-driven approach to feature development
